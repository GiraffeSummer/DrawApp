**TODO:**


**Must Haves**
- [x] add mongodb support (requests and art)
- [x] load last  instance
- [x] color picker tool (dropper)
- [x] basic bot protection
- [ ] rate limits
- [ ] embedding an image (for the web devs)  (possible to work in <img>)
- [ ] Downloading image as png/jpg
- [ ] different sessions (based on id or something) so multiple arts
- [ ] check if updated correctly to DB (_UpdateGrid()_ function)


**Useful extras**
- [ ] color history (5-10 last used colors)
- [ ] discord embeds


**Cool later features**

- [ ] maybe some cool data stuff, like most changed pixels and most used colours and stuff  
    - maybe some cool graphs  
    - for colour per square or something  

**bugs**
- [x] check artwork resetting
